| Published in?                | August 23, 2019 |
| General topic?               | The article explains why the koalas die, which method has been invented to help them, and how this method can be realised |
| Procedure/what was examined? | There are different koalas, these that eat Manna gum, or these that messmate. And these koalas have different microbiomes in their gut that allow them to eat a specific food. The goal of the fecal transplants is to allow the koalas that eat exclusively maana gum to feed on messmate. This is done via fecal transpants, poop pills, that contain the messmate-munching microbes. It's introduced in the koalas' gut. This method allows the koalas that eat manna gum to "recieve" a new microbiome. |
| Conclusions/discovery?       | This method is concluding and can be now combined with the breast milk and a mother's green poop. This strange mixture transmits the microbiome to the next generation, and can be used to prevent the dead of the koalas. The researchers also can turn this to fecal transplants to counterbalance the effects of antibiotics which can kill the good bacterias of the microbiome. They make a probiotic milkshake |
| Remaining questions?         |  “So the hope now is that by using a modified version of this approach, it will give us a way to improve the number of koalas that recover from these sorts of treatments and get them back out there, where they need to survive if populations are going to persist.”|
