| General topic?               | Explanation of the faecal transplantation, and explanation of the problems with the populations of koalas and their unique food.                       |
| Procedure/what was examined? | The populations of koalas are increasing. They eat a unique food and this action causes the decrease of edible plants. The problem is that they are unable to eat another thing, and then they could die. The feacal transplant would be a solution to stop the extinction. It would be done via bacterias and would boost the microbiome of the marsupials and allow them to eat a slightly wider range of food than the one specific type of eucalyptus. The transplants are done via tubes, inserted into the nostril, down the throat and into the stomach or directly into the colon.|
| Conclusions/discovery?       |  The faecal inoculations changed the koalas' microbiomes, and these koalas are now allowed to eat another plants (messmate). In future, the feacal transplants could be used to adjust the koalas' microbiomes before to move them into an another place, where they could find their new and abundant food. There are unfortunatly bad points... There have been reports of patients showing unexpected weight gain after treatment, bouts of vomiting and even abdominal pain.      |
| Remaining questions?         | There are again many questions about the security and the health of the koalas, but the researchers have called for more studies to deepen the researches and find all the risks and lon-term effects. |
