13/10/19: I worked on my blog. I found websites to work on my portfolio's topic. I've consulted the "DailyMail" website and chosen two articles. 
I learned the specific vocabulary, and i've started the analysis of my 1st article.

18/10/19: I finished the analysis table and the vocabulary. The post of my first article is finalised. I watched a YouTube video. 

20/10/19: I finalised my first aricle and brought modifications. 
I watched a youtube vid√©o for my topic (koalas).

31/10/2019: I worked on my second article. I found and choosed this article that will be posted on this blog speedly.

02/11/2019: The second article has been posted. I've done the vocabulary table, and the analysis table. The section "About" has been actualised to become clearer. 
In a second time, i found my third article for my portfolio.
