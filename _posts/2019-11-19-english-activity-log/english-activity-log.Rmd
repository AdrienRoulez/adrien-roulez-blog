**13/10/19**: I worked on my blog. I found websites to work on my portfolio's topic. I've consulted the "*DailyMail*" website and chosen two articles. 
I learned the specific vocabulary, and i've started the analysis of my 1st article.

**18/10/19**: I finished the analysis table and the vocabulary. The post of my first article is finalised. I watched a YouTube video. 

**20/10/19**: I finalised my first aricle and brought modifications. 
I watched a youtube vid√©o for my topic (koalas).

**31/10/2019**: I worked on my second article. I found and choosed this article that will be posted on this blog speedly.

**02/11/2019**: The second article has been posted. I've done the vocabulary table, and the analysis table. The section "About" has been actualised to become clearer. 
In a second time, i found my third article for my portfolio. 

**30/11/2019**: I worked on my fourth article, found the specific vocabulary, and understood more words than ever. This article has been posted on my blog, and it's now accessible with the analysis. I also found my fifth article, and i'll work on very soon. Since two or three weeks, when i go to school, and i'm listening my music, i try to understand all the lyrics. Sometimes It's a bit difficult, but at the end, it will be effective for me to improve my comprehension of the language.

**01/12/2019**: I worked on my fifth article, and read a lot of others. I post here all the links of the articles that i've read. These articles will not be posted and analysed on my blog, but i think it's important for the readers to have access to anothers articles.
