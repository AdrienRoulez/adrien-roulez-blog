| General topic?               |  This article explains the procedure to make the koalas eat a wider range of food, and how it is done with a scientific method: The fecal transplants to change the microbiome of the koalas' gut.                      |
| Procedure/what was examined? | The method is called " fecal transplants ". They collected poo from radio-collared wild koalas that ate messmate, and concentrated the microorganisms in the poo. Then, they packaged it into acid-resistant capsules and gave them to the captive koalas. The procedure had to show if the captive koalas could now eat another variety of trees. |
| Conclusions/discovery?       | Finally, the koalas' microbiomes changed, allowing them to eat antother variety of Eucalyptus, the messmate.      |
| Remaining questions?         | These transplants could affect all aspects of the koalas' ecology including nutrition, habitat selection and resource use. These questions will be resolved in the future, when all the effects of the transplants will be detected. |
