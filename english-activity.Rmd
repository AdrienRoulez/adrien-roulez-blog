**13/10/19**: I worked on my blog. I found websites to work on my portfolio's topic. I've consulted the "*DailyMail*" website and chosen two articles. 
I learned the specific vocabulary, and i've started the analysis of my 1st article.

**18/10/19**: I finished the analysis table and the vocabulary. The post of my first article is finalised. I watched a YouTube video. 

**20/10/19**: I finalised my first aricle and brought modifications. 
I watched a youtube vid√©o for my topic (*koalas*).

**31/10/2019**: I worked on my second article. I found and choosed this article that will be posted on this blog speedly. I always do a few listening exercices with the *music* i'm listening when i go to school. Nowadays it's a bit difficult to concentrate myself on the *lyrics*, but i'll do this until i understand the pieces of music i'm always listening to.

**02/11/2019**: The second article has been posted. I've done the vocabulary table, and the analysis table. The section "About" has been actualised to become clearer. 
In a second time, i found my third article for my portfolio. 

**29/11/2019**: I worked on my protfolio. I found new articles, very interesting, that will be posted very quickly. I looked after the news around the world, with the *BBC App*. I always listen to music when i'm going to school, and now I note that it's more simply for me to understand the *lyrics*, and the signifcation of the music.
