13/10/19: I worked on my blog. I found websites to work on my portfolio's topic. I've consulted the "DailyMail" website and chosen two articles. 
I learned the specific vocabulary, and i've started the analysis of my 1st article.

18/10/19: I finished the analysis table and the vocabulary. The post of my first article is finalised. I looked a YouTube video.
